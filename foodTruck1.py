# This module implements Baker et al.'s Food Truck problem
# in which the agent must infer a student's food preferences.

# There are three types of truck: Korean, Lebanese, and Mexican.
# Each student has a strict preference ordering over food types, 
# and the agent's job is to predict the student's behavior.
